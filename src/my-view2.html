      <p>
        i graduated from <span id="highlight">brown university</span> in may of 2015 with a concentration in computer science. while in school, i took full advantage of the open curriculum by taking classes in 14 departments and assistant teaching 4 courses; i even designed my own history course! some of my favorite cs courses were data science, humanity-centered robotics, and intro to computer systems. some of my favorite non-cs courses were logic (philosophy), material culture in early america (history), and pathology of power (public health).
